## Test Driven Development Approach was used

Code for Unit test and Red/Green test can be found in ğŸ“¦trace subdirectory

# Running Trace

Uncomment `r.tracer = trace.New(os.Stdout)` in `main.go` under the ğŸ“¦chat subdirectory and also comment `tracer:  trace.Off(),` in `room.go` under the ğŸ“¦chat subdirectory and run `go build -o githubuserChat` and then run `./githubuserChat`, watch your terminal to see the output of the trace information

# NOTE: `githubuserChat` is just the output name it could be changed to any name of your choice
